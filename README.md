# Intro

Ardunio code for a DIY aquarium CO2 and Fertilizer dosing system.

Based on http://fishtankprojects.com/diy-aquarium-projects/arduino-controlled-dosing-pumps/

Using 2 `dosing pumps`, `Arduino Nano`, `LCD display` and a couple other bits. Did use a `Real Time Clock` but this died, although is still physically installed. Code changed to just countdown using internal clock.

Doses `EasyLife` `EasyCarbo` and `Profito`

- `EasyCarbo` @ 6.5ml / day (or 0.81ml per 3h as currently configured)
- `Profito` @ 3ml / day (or 0.37ml per 3h as currently configured)
